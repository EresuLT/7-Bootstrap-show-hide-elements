# 5-SASS-project

Here is my 7th project. I've made this form by using HTML & CSS skills. Also I've used bootstrap for styling my project. 
In this project, We have made this sizing project for learning how bootstrap show-hide codes changes our website's media visibility.
I learned how to shape website with HTML and CSS codes and how to use bootstrap codes for websites.

As an engineer, I was familiar with IT world but this step was one of my life changing step. 
I'm beginning to a journey which I'm planning to be a perfect Software Developer.
Let's move on...
